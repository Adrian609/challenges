# Drew AndrÃ© - Launch Academy Ignition week #1: Street Show Challenge PART 1
# 7.18.17

# This assignment was submitted pretty late. For a while I was working on a slightly more complex solution
# but I ended up just missing the deadline. Oops. Won't happen again.
# I'll leave where I left off below this assignment. I was exploring the use of:
# => the split() function so that a user could enter the trick ID number (0,1,2, or 3) follow directly by the tip amount\
# => while loops from week 2 curriculum so the user could continuously enter tips
# => begin, rescue, and retry for user input validation
# => array summing, mapping, and shifting.

# Ideally the user could enter the trick number, followed by the tip amount in a variety of formats (i.e. '1, 2.10' or '0 $3.10')
# and ruby would shift out the trick number, validate the rest of the array, sum it up, and total/average it after the user entered 'done'
# The user could also enter 'help' and print the instructions again.

# Anyway, I got stuck on converting the rest of the array to integers AND summing it. Also got stuck on the use of retry. Learned a lot though!

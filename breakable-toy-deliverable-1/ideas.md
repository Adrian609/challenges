# Breakable Toy Ideas

I’ll be designing a dashboard that will control LED products I’ve designed using a Particle Photon WiFi board. I’ll start with a form that will post the information to an API endpoint which the particle board can (very easily) subscribe to. Users will be able to log in, register their product, and have full control over its settings from anywhere in the world. This is especially useful for some of my clients whom I have installed custom corporate lobby lighting for. For example, they can log in and change the color palette for specific holidays and choose API to subscribe to. By subscribing to an API, users will be able to have my LED products react to certain API data. Live weather data could be mapped to the lights, for example. Or a company could subscribe to their own API and have the lights in their lobby react to certain information. I’m still working through this idea. Users will also be able to create their own color palettes from the dashboard (pick from a color wheel or possibly upload a photo and choose HEX colors from it) and have the lights display the palette.
